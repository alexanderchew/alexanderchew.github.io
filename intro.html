        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Alexander Chew, and I am a passionate student at Han Chiang High School. Currently, I'm 13 years old, and I have a deep interest in technology, programming, and engineering. From a young age, I've been intrigued by how things work and have always enjoyed diving into new projects to improve my skills. Whether it's coding, building circuits, or designing with LaTeX, I'm constantly learning and exploring new areas in the world of tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always eager to grow my knowledge, work on exciting projects, and connect with others who share my passion for innovation. This portfolio is a showcase of the skills I've developed so far and the projects I've worked on, with many more to come as I continue my journey.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Here are the technical skills I've been developing:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>C++ (Intermediate):</strong>
                I have a solid understanding of C++ programming and have worked on various projects ranging from simple algorithms to more complex problem-solving tasks. Through my studies and self-learning, I've gained experience in using object-oriented programming concepts and developing efficient code.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Arduino (Beginner):</strong>
                As a beginner in Arduino, I'm currently learning how to work with microcontrollers to create interactive projects. I've built a few simple circuits and programmed them to perform basic tasks, such as controlling LEDs and sensors. This is just the beginning, and I'm eager to expand my skills in robotics and IoT.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>LaTeX (Beginner):</strong>
                I'm currently exploring LaTeX for creating high-quality documents, particularly useful for writing research papers, technical reports, and presentations. I've learned the basics of formatting documents and equations, and I plan to continue mastering it for academic purposes.
