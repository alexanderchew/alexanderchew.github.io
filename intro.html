        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Alexander Chew, and I am a passionate student at Han Chiang High School. Currently, I'm 13 years old, and I have a deep interest in technology, programming, and engineering. From a young age, I've been intrigued by how things work and have always enjoyed diving into new projects to improve my skills. Whether it's coding, building circuits, or designing with LaTeX, I'm constantly learning and exploring new areas in the world of tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always eager to grow my knowledge, work on exciting projects, and connect with others who share my passion for innovation. This portfolio is a showcase of the skills I've developed so far and the projects I've worked on, with many more to come as I continue my journey.
